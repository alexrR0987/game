there is a map under development, it is right outside the main map, not for version 0.0.8 but for version 0.0.9 
break out of the main map and i might just give you credit :)

by the way, had to break the news to you but, i had to remove the good shadows we were getting from realtime lights, i know i know, but it was affecting the locomotion with lag at spawn, like, people would float and everything. :(
